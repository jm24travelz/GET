# GET1033 Project: Autonomous Car Washing System 

# Jonathan Mohan | Chua Hong Huei
 
# Overview
 Ever wanted to get a car wash done quickly without the need to wait for an attendant? 
 Look no further as we will be designing an Autonomous Car Washing System to replace the current systems available at petrol kiosks island wide. 
 The system would automatically detect the arrival of a car and would proceed to go through a set of automatic procedures to wash the car when it is in the washing bay area. 
 Our project’s aim is to reduce manpower and labour cost, while seeking to improve the efficiency during peak periods 
 
# Sensors required
1.	3 LED Light Module 
2.	1 Proximity Sensor
3.	3 Servo Motors 
4.	Emergency Push Button 
5.	Reset Push Button

# Proposed Timeline
•	Week 8-9: Consolidate on the current plan and ensure that the entire process is feasible. Find out about the sensors available for students to use in the project. Read up on Arduino programming and start working on the code. 

• Week 10: Complete the coding process, ensure that there are no errors in the code (flow).  At the same time start working on the mock up prototype we will need for the physical demonstration

•	Week 11-12: Collect data required for individual sensors through testing out the code using a working prototype. Calibrate the code to ensure it is fully functional. Work on our project documentation for the final presentation using github.com

•	Week 13: Minor fine tuning, before the actual presentation. Coding Complete, step by step workflow process complete, reflections complete. Prototype completed for presentation

# Operation

1)	The car would be directed into the washing bay, through an indication via the green LED light module. The front proximity sensors would ensure that the car is completely in the washing bay. The 3 LED Light Module would guide the driver on the distance to the designated washing bay based on the front proximity sensor.
Green LED: Drive In
Orange LED: Slow Down
Red LED: Stop
